## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts

**1. Be Specific and Clear**

❌ Bad:
```
Write something about AI.
```

✅ Good:
```
Write a 500-word article explaining how AI is transforming healthcare.
Focus on diagnostic tools, treatment planning, and patient outcomes.
Target audience: healthcare professionals with basic AI knowledge.
```

**2. Provide Context**

❌ Bad:
```
Summarize this.
```

✅ Good:
```
Summarize the following research paper in 200 words.
Focus on the methodology, key findings, and implications for future research.
Audience: Graduate students in computer science.
```

**3. Specify Output Format**

❌ Bad:
```
Tell me about Python functions.
```

✅ Good:
```
Explain Python functions in the following format:
1. Definition and purpose (2-3 sentences)
2. Syntax with code example
3. Parameters and return values
4. Common use cases (3 examples)
5. Best practices (bullet points)
```

**4. Include Examples**

❌ Bad:
```
Generate product descriptions.
```

✅ Good:
```
Generate product descriptions following this style:

Example:
"Introducing the CloudRun Pro - your ultimate running companion.
Features: GPS tracking, heart rate monitoring, 10-day battery life.
Perfect for serious athletes who demand precision and reliability."

Create descriptions in the same style for: {product_name}
```

**5. Define Constraints**

❌ Bad:
```
Write code to sort data.
```

✅ Good:
```
Write a Python function to sort data with these requirements:
- Use built-in sorting (no external libraries)
- Handle list of dictionaries
- Sort by multiple keys (priority: 'date' then 'name')
- Include error handling for invalid input
- Add docstring and type hints
- Time complexity: O(n log n)
```
